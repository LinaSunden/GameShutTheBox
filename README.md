# Game - Shut the box 

Shut the box

A digital version of an analog game. The goal is to score as few points as possible. 
The player rolls two dice and matches the values on the dice with game tiles numbered from 1 to 10. 
The standard is to play to 45 points, but players can choose to compete against a higher or lower value. The first to reach the maximum points loses.
